	The roguelike blackjack game
===========================================

In Suit Up, you take on the role of Suiter,
a plucky person on an exciting adventure.
Armed with a trusty deck of cards, explore
winding paths as you plot the best course
through each stage. Battle enemies who will
try to stand in your way, always keeping an
eye out for more chips, health upgrades,
and even valuable gilded cards with special
effects.

===========================================
		CONTROLS
===========================================

* ESCAPE: Quit
* MOUSE: Select buttons / move Suiter

===========================================
		 COMBAT
===========================================

Suiter and foes play blackjack to sort out
their differences. You and your opponent
each have a standard deck of 52 playing
cards from which to draw, the goal being to 
get as close to 21 as possible without
going over. If you go over 21, you BUST.
Aces are worth 1 or 11; Faces are worth 10.
You are dealt two cards, at which point you
are able to select an action this turn.

Actions
-------
STRONG
 Damage: High; Defense: Low
ATTACK
 Damage: Medium; Defense: Medium
BLOCK
 Damage: Low; Defense: High

After you select your action, you choose to
HIT or STAY. 

HIT: Draw a card. (Be careful not to BUST)
STAY: Stop drawing cards and use this hand

If your total is closer to 21 than your
opponent, and you don't BUST, you win the
round. You get to attack your opponent.
